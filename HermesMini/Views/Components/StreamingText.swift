//
//  StreamingText.swift
//  Conduit
//
//  Character-paced streaming text reveal.
//
//  Tokens arrive in unpredictable bursts from the WebSocket. This component
//  decouples visual reveal from data arrival. Characters are admitted at a
//  steady, adaptive pace and retain individual reveal timestamps, allowing
//  the Markdown renderer to fade the newest glyphs independently.
//
//  Once the accumulated text crosses the large-document threshold, the
//  component switches to a bounded mode: everything behind the live tail is
//  promoted into immutable chunks (rendered once through the ordinary
//  cached path) and only the tail — a window of a few KB — keeps
//  re-rendering per tick. Without this, a 1 MB stream re-parses and
//  re-lays-out the whole document at 30 fps (measured 0.8–3.3 s per frame).
