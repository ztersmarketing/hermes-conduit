//
//  Hosted-ChatView regression for the scene-update watchdog crash
//  (0x8BADF00D, main thread inside ScrollViewCommitMutation under
//  GraphHost.flushTransactions): rich content whose intrinsic height
//  settles repeatedly used to drive
//
//      geometry preference change
//          → layoutMetricsChanged (one per preference callback)
//          → synchronous scrollTo(bottom) inside the layout pass
//          → ScrollViewCommitMutation → more geometry changes → scrollTo …
//
//  The pure ChatViewportControllerTests cover the coalescing state machine;
//  these tests host the REAL ChatView (real ScrollViewReader, real scrollTo,
//  real preference pipeline) and assert the integrated behavior with BOTH
//  bounds: growth while following produces a POSITIVE, bounded number of
//  corrections/scrolls (a broken zero-correction implementation must fail),
//  and settled layout churn produces exactly zero.
